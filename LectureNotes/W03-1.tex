\subsection{Proton Discovery: The Rutherford Scattering Experiment}

Thomson's model of the atom was a positive sphere with electrons embedded in it. Rutherford wanted to test this model by shooting alpha particles at a thin gold foil surrounded by a detector foil. The alpha particles were shot from a radioactive source and when the alpha particles exited, they hit the foil and emitted light. 
\subsubsection{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Most alpha particles went straight through the foil. This implies the atom is mostly empty space.
    \item Some alpha particles were deflected by a small angle. This implies the positive charge is concentrated in a small volume.
    \item Sometimes the particles travel backwards. This implies the positive center has most of the mass of the atom.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Discovery of the Neutron}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shooting alpha particles on beryllium which is much lighter than gold. This 
\end{itemize}

\section{Nucleus}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Very dense. Carries all the mass. $2.7 â‹… 10^{14}$ times denser than water.
    \item The atom is mostly empty space. If the nucleus was the size of a coin, the atom would be 2-3 km in radius. 
\end{itemize}
